This repository contains a simple Java program that illustrates three common runtime exceptions: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException, and ArithmeticException. The program demonstrates how to handle these exceptions using try-catch blocks, which is a crucial aspect of robust Java programming.  The solution file shows improved error handling and input validation.
